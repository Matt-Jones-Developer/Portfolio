# Portfolio - Matt Jones

## Description

Welcome to my portfolio!
Probably the most important project to complete (next to actual deployed web apps!), this repo will serve as a home to a unique web app that introduces myself to the world as a professional web developer and showcases my best work. 

It includes an about me section, a projects section, a skills and contact section, sticky navbar and raised footer.

I want the portfolio to take on a more 'working professional' vibe compared to my 'metal-bio' project page which really was a chance to have fun, to express my personality and interests.  This site is fully responsive as per the criteria and I am really pleased with how far I've come in just a few weeks.  There were lots of challenges, changes and updates required for this project, I'd estimate over 80 hours were poured into this portfolio.

## Installation

Links to each project are provided through each projects link text. I wish I'd had time to refactor all of my other projects code too, but I will.

For the Python project, you will need to download the repo, install the correct python version (I like pyenv with a virtual environment) and then add the dependencies via requirements.txt on your system - instructions are provided.  I plan to make this game fully UI based in the future, complete with animations and a live leaderboard!

## Design & Features

When I first set out in designing this portfolio I had many complicated ideas and revised my design several times.  

I much prefer what I ended up with to represent myself and my work, I am also really happy to say I did implement the gameboy scrolling images idea within the gameboy assets project site!  I felt it just made more sense and this new idea looks clean and meets all the requirements of the acceptance criteria.

I will endeavour to include the following goals for this project:

- Sticky Navbar: DONE
- GRID of coloured squares: DONE - overcame a lot here, even tried to implement a random(math) function in JS, but it didn't really work and decided to omit it.  I am really happy with how this came out and I will make the colours randomise to random squares once I have a better grasp of JavaScript.

- site is 100% responsive on any device or screen adjustment: DONE 
- each project image link contains: transparent bg text section layered over the image with intro blurb: DONE
- Light/Dark switch: TODO

- main font to be a custom web-font: Decided to add custom fonts only to the gameboy project and to bio-metal in the end.  Very happy with Raleway as the main font to use in my portfolio as it looks clean.
  
- make the titles 'spell out' the letters?: TODO
- fading/blending/zooming main background image: Implemented then removed due to Safari causing issues.  Decided that it wasn't necessary especially on mobile views. Good fun figuring it out and working with transition: transform for the first time.  I feel my site already showcases my understanding of CSS animation quite nicely so, 'less is more' as they say.

- animated 'sections' similar to the titles on my bio-page: TODO - I want entire sections to slide in and out as you scroll but I will save for future feature.

- showcase my design skills via 'graphics commissions' including guitars and amps, the Gameboy game assets projects: DONE both Gameboy and some Guitar on metal-bio.

- my best work to date (webpages, apps, design, music) with html, css, python etc: DONE (I reluctantly ommited the link to Cristal Vision's website as I currently have it down for maintenance; a lot of bugs written back when I was just starting out!  But all the other links work great.

- homepage (the main back/return to page) has 2 sections (projects + about me)  - went with a single page l;ayout in the end, but I did include smooth scrolling links to each section which work great.

- navbar has collapsing burger menu for mobile views containing 'projects' 'web development' 'graphic design' and 'about me', CV PDF + 'contact' as another route to call to action: TODO 

- add my music (which track?) and a Soundcloud widget to turn it on/off: Implemented but removed due to web formatting issues: TODO! I still have a basic link which works just fine.

- responsive screenshots embedded/skewed into iphone images! - TODO - When you click on a project image, I'd like it to open a page dedicated to how and why the site was made, the issues I overcame and screenshots of it's responsive design in mobile view.

## Mock-up Design

- layout design - what goes where and why.
- colour palette - how I chose them and why.
- any graphic or font design or workflow - why I chose them.
- How the design helped to cater for all the project FEATURES above.
