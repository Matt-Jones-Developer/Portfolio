# Portfolio - Matt Jones

## Description

Welcome to my portfolio!
Probably the most important project to complete (next to actual deployed web apps!), this repo will serve as a home to a unique web app that introduces myself to the world as a professional web developer and showcases my best work. 

It includes an about me section, a projects section, a skills and contact section, sticky navbar and raised footer.

I want the portfolio to take on a more 'working professional' vibe compared to my 'metal-bio' project page which really was a chance to have fun, to express my personality and interests.  This site is fully responsive as per the criteria and I am really pleased with how far I've come in just a few weeks.  There were lots of challenges, changes and updates required for this project, I'd estimate over 80 hours were poured into this portfolio.

The criteria for this project are listed within the Acceptance Criteria section of this readme guide.

## Installation

Links to each project are provided through each projects link text. I wish I'd had time to refactor all of my other projects code too, but I will.

For the Python project, you will need to download the repo, install the correct python version (I like pyenv with a virtual environment) and then add the dependencies via requirements.txt on your system - instructions are provided.  I plan to make this game fully UI based in the future, complete with animations and a live leaderboard!

## Acceptance Criteria

I have met and exceeded the Acceptance Criteria by completing the following:

When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you: DONE

When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section: DONE

When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications: DONE

When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others: DONE 

When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application: 

*I am not sure if that's possible?  I researched but found nothing.  I tagged the text descriptions on each image as anchors.  I hope this is acceptable.*

When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport: DONE


## Design & Features

When I first set out in designing this portfolio I had many complicated ideas and revised my design several times.  

I much prefer what I ended up with to represent myself and my work, I am also really happy to say I did implement the gameboy scrolling images idea within the gameboy assets project site!  I felt it just made more sense and this new idea looks clean and meets all the requirements of the acceptance criteria.

I will endeavour to include the following goals for this project:

- Sticky Navbar: DONE
- GRID of coloured squares: DONE - overcame a lot here, even tried to implement a random(math) function in JS, but it did'nt really work and decided to omit it.  I am really happy with how this came out and I will make the colours randomise to random squares once I have a better grasp of JavaScript.

- site is 100% responsive on any device or screen adjustment: DONE 
- each project image link contains: transparent bg text section layered over the image with intro blurb: DONE
- Light/Dark switch: TODO

- main font to be a custom web-font: Decided to add custom fonts only to the gameboy project and to bio-metal in the end.  Very happy with Raleway as the main font to use in my portfolio as it looks clean.
  
- make the titles 'spell out' the letters?: TODO
- fading/blending/zooming main background image: Implemented then removed due to Safari causing issues.  Decided that it wasn't necessary especially on mobile views. Good fun figuring it out and working with transition: transform for the first time.  I feel my site already showcases my understanding of CSS animation quite nicely so, 'less is more' as they say.

- animated 'sections' similar to the titles on my bio-page: TODO - I want entire sections to slide in and out as you scroll but I will save for future feature.

- showcase my design skills via 'graphics commissions' including guitars and amps, the Gameboy game assets projects: DONE both Gameboy and some Guitar on metal-bio.

- my best work to date (webpages, apps, design, music) with html, css, python etc: DONE (I reluctantly ommited the link to Cristal Vision's website as I currently have it down for maintenance; a lot of bugs written back when I was just starting out!  But all the other links work great.

- homepage (the main back/return to page) has 2 sections (projects + about me)  - went with a single page l;ayout in the end, but I did include smooth scrolling links to each section which work great.

- navbar has collapsing burger menu for mobile views containing 'projects' 'web development' 'graphic design' and 'about me', CV PDF + 'contact' as another route to call to action: TODO 

- add my music (which track?) and a Soundcloud widget to turn it on/off: Implemented but removed due to web formatting issues: TODO! I still have a basic link which works just fine.

- responsive screenshots embedded/skewed into iphone images! - TODO - When you click on a project image, I'd like it to open a page dedicated to how and why the site was made, the issues I overcame and screenshots of it's responsive design in mobile view.

## Mock-up Design

mockup - show the actual mockup I designed before coding - as a screenshot here. 

- layout design - what goes where and why.
- colour palette - how I chose them and why.
- any graphic or font design or workflow - why I chose them.
- How the design helped to cater for all the project FEATURES above.


## Project Annotation

I wanted to mention what the motivation was behind each project, what I enjoyed, what I struggled with and how I overcame it - so I will have to put that here since the brief requires the project links load the deployed sites (my idea was to have a small intro (annotations) with links for the sites github repo and deployment link)
