# Portfolio - Matt Jones

## Description

Welcome to my portfolio!
Probably the most important project to complete (next to actual deployed web apps!), this repo will serve as a home to a unique web app that introduces myself to the world as a professional web developer and showcases my best work. 

I will include a projects page, bio page and a contacts footer and each project will show the thought process behind it and mention what I enjoyed about building it and what issues I overcame.  Keeping it short and concise.

I want the portfolio to take on a more 'working professional' vibe compared to my bio-page which really was a chance to have fun, to express my personality and interests.

The criteria for this project are listed within the Acceptance Criteria section of this readme guide.

## Installation

Links to each project are provided through this web app.  For Python projects, you will need to either download them as a package (if available), or install the correct python version and add the dependencies via requirements.txt on your system - instructions are provided!

*TODO - add a good screenshot of the homepage*

## Acceptance Criteria

I have met and exceeded the Acceptance Criteria by completing the following:

When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you

When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications

When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others 

*will need to set the size larger, whilst still being responsive on this one? I wanted to do a grid!*

When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application *this does not allow me to add any annotation content then*

When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

This repo must have:

unique name
proper file structure and naming conventions, classes and id's, quality comments
!! multiple descriptive commit messages!!


## Design & Features

Could be bundled with the mock-up below?

I will endeavour to include the following goals for this project:
- site is 100% responsive on any device or screen adjustment 
- each project image link contains: transparent bg text section layered over the image with intro blurb, repo and deployed links within it
- Light/Dark switch
- main font to be a custom web-font
- make the titles 'spell out' the letters?
- fading/blending/zooming main background image
- animated 'sections' similar to the titles on my bio-page
- showcase my design skills via 'graphics commissions' including guitars and amps, the Gameboy game assets projects
- my best work to date (webpages, apps, design, music) with html, css, python etc
- homepage (the main back/return to page) has 2 sections (projects + about me)  
- navbar has collapsing burger menu for mobile views containing 'projects' 'web development' 'graphic design' and 'about me', CV PDF + 'contact' as another route to call to action
- add my music (which track?) and a Soundcloud widget to turn it on/off
- responsive screenshots embedded/skewed into iphone images! 

## Mock-up Design

mockup - show the actual mockup I designed before coding - as a screenshot here. 

- layout design - what goes where and why.
- colour palette - how I chose them and why.
- any graphic or font design or workflow - why I chose them.
- How the design helped to cater for all the project FEATURES above.


## Project Annotation

I wanted to mention what the motivation was behind each project, what I enjoyed, what I struggled with and how I overcame it - so I will have to put that here since the brief requires the project links load the deployed sites (my idea was to have a small intro (annotations) with links for the sites github repo and deployment link)
